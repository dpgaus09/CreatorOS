# Multi-Tenant Architecture Guide for Learner_Bruh LMS

This guide explains how the Learner_Bruh LMS application implements multi-tenancy for multiple instructors and their students.

## Current Multi-Tenant Architecture

Learner_Bruh LMS already implements a basic multi-tenant model where:

1. **Instructors are tenants**:
   - Each instructor account acts as a separate "tenant" in the system
   - Instructors can only manage their own courses and content
   - All instructor data is isolated using database relationships

2. **Data isolation**:
   - Every course has an `instructorId` that links it to a specific instructor
   - Database queries filter content by instructor ID for appropriate isolation
   - Students only see courses they're enrolled in

3. **Authentication and roles**:
   - The system already has role-based access control (instructor vs student)
   - Each role has appropriate permissions and UI views

## Quick Start for Instructors

As an instructor, you can create your own "tenant space" by:

1. **Register as an instructor**: Create your instructor account
2. **Create courses**: Add your course content
3. **Share enrollment links**: Students register and can enroll in your courses
4. **Manage your content**: All your courses are isolated from other instructors

## Individual Instructor Branding

Each instructor can customize their "space" by:

1. **Course branding**: Upload custom images and content for your courses
2. **Student experience**: Students only see your courses when logged in to your space
3. **Announcements**: Create announcements that are visible to your students

## Database Structure Supporting Multi-Tenancy

The database is already structured for multi-tenancy:

```
users
├── id
├── username
├── password
├── role: "instructor" | "student"
└── ...

courses
├── id
├── title
├── description
├── instructorId (links to users)
└── ...

enrollments
├── id
├── studentId (links to users)
├── courseId (links to courses)
└── ...
```

This structure ensures:
- Each course belongs to exactly one instructor
- Students can enroll in courses from different instructors
- Instructors cannot access other instructors' courses

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying with this multi-tenant architecture:

1. **Single database**: All tenants share the same database with logical separation
2. **Single application instance**: One deployment serves all instructors and students
3. **Scalability**: The app can handle many instructors without configuration changes

## Using the Application

1. Register as an instructor
2. Create and manage your courses
3. View only your students and course analytics

### For Students:
